## What is this?

This is an HTTP API that previously allowed you to download unblured CourseHero documents (up to 9 pages) for completely free. CourseHero has changed their method of previewing document, so this no longer works. I decided to open source this since it may be of some use to someone, someday.

## Credits

This project was inspired by [daijro's](https://github.com/daijro) [CourseHeroUnblur](https://github.com/daijro/CourseHeroUnblur) project. It shares a lot of similarities with that project, however this project was written from scratch with the exception of a tiny bit of processing logic.
